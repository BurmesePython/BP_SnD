zone_detect: most important. Used to detect supply and demand zone, error within is that it begins to search for demand zone same place where it sees "supply zone" and viceversa and it should not be there at all

Trend_detection: secondary importance: the one that gave most problem. Trend detection logic is sound but implementation is poor. you said to scrap

delete_later: in depth of trend_detection wity matplotlib 

deldelete: new trend detection using github code, cannot even detect symbol bruv

Goal 1: get a working trend detection on volatilities index which I know exist somewhere already made!!!


Goal 2: pefect zone detect, follow with zone detect in-depth

Goal 3: join code together,backtest
